# How to become a Turing Student
<br /><br /><br />

1. **Attend Try Coding event**<br />
	1.1. Get a feel for Turing, see if it is a good culture fit for you.
	1.2. While participating, think about which program seems to make more sense.
		1.2.1. It might all still be confusing and overwhelming, but when you do something correctly, is it exciting? What about it is exciting?
	1.3. Ask questions about anything and everything.
<br />

2. **Practice Coding at Home**<br />
	2.1. Take a few courses on Codecademy or Udemy to see if it still interests you
<br />

3. **Apply for Front End or Back End Engineering program**<br />
	3.1. Fill out Basic Identity and Contact Information
	3.2. Fill out Work History
		3.2.1. This is to understand where you are coming from, there are no wrong answers
	3.3. Take the Logic Quiz
		3.3.1. This quiz is comprised of eight Logical Thinking problems
			3.3.1.1. If you are nervous, look at example LSAT logic problems for a better idea
		3.3.2. Take your time on the quiz, it is more important to get the correct answer than to finish in a 'timely manner'
<br />

4. **Interview**<br />
	4.1. **Logic Problems, Continued**
		4.1.1. You will talk through your problem solving process with a Turing Professor so they can get an idea of your logic skills
	4.2. **Culture Fit and More Info About You**
		4.2.1. Discuss the Turing environment to determine if Turing is a good fit for you
		4.2.2. The staff member will ask more questions to further understand your situation and how you found yourself applying to Turing
<br />

5. **Solidify Finances**<br />
	5.1. Turing tuition is $20,500, and it is not advised to work during the program.
		5.1.1. Loans are available through four loan providers
		5.1.2. You are also welcome to privately finance the program any way you see fit.

6. **Put Down Deposit and Secure Cohort**<br />
	6.1. The deposit for Turing is $1200 and cannot be financed.
		6.1.1. This covers the cost of your laptop.
	6.2. Select a cohort
<br />

7. **Enroll and Complete Mod 0**<br />
	7.1. Enroll in an available Mod 0 Session
	7.2. Complete all homework assignments
	7.3. Take Technical Assessment
	7.4. Make sure everything else is in order prep work wise
	7.5. **Complete Mod 0 Capstone Project**
		7.5.1. Formerly known as Pre-Work, your Mod 0 Capstone Project is due after you complete Mod 0
<br />

8. **Continue Coding Until Mod 1 Begins**<br />
	8.1. Get in the habit of coding every day
	8.2. Continue to work on the website you have made for show and tell and make it as cool as possible while you learn!
